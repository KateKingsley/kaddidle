        <div class="sectionheading">Tomato plant experiment in nutrient deficiencies</div>
        

            <p>
            In this experiment we have placed three tomato plants in each beaker. The roots are cleaned of 
            soil and the plant is gently padded around the base of the stem to keep it in place. Each beaker 
            has one essential nutrient missing from the solution allowing us to measure and observe the 
            harmful effects on the plants.    
            </p>
            <p>
            As water is taken up by the plants it will be topped off again 
            only with distilled water. In time all plants will deplete aviable nutrients in solution.
            After a certain point in the experiment there will be an attempt to save damaged plants by 
            introducing proper nutrition into the solution and observing the recovery.
            </p>

            element, it is time to see if the plant can be saved by giving it the missing nutrient. As you can see in the picture three
            beakers have blue water. From left to right the blue beakers contain plants:  missing Nitrogen, only given tap and distilled water.
