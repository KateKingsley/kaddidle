            Defined as "arrangement of soil particles into aggregates"<br />
            Soil structure can be altered by the addition of organic material such as compost or humus 
            because organic material helps to form aggregates. Aggregates are composed of many soil particles held 
            in a single mass or cluster such as a clod, crumb, block, or prism.
            <br />

            <br />
            Structures distinguishes soil from weathered rock<br />
            Structure is degraded in cultivated soils<br />
            Structure impacts pore spaces between aggregates
            <br />
            <br />

        <span class="topic">Particle Arrangement</span>
        <br />
            Some aggregates are stronger than others<br />
            Clay and humus are most important binding agents<br />
            Aggregates or peds
            Soil particles held together by stabilizing agents
            Described according to their shape, size, and stability = how easy they can be broken apart
            Soil has structure when most soil particles are aggregated
            Structure is an important morphological characteristic
            Controls the size and number of pores
            Kind of structure is determined by the kind of aggregates in the soil
            <br />
            <br />

        <span class="topic">Structure-less soil – does not form aggregates</span>
        <br />
            Non-aggregated soil is not bound together such as sand<br />
            Massive
            All particles are stuck together 
            No individual aggregates
            Single grain
            Each particle acts individually 
            Sand dunes and beaches
            Very likely to erode
            <br />
            <br />

        <span class="topic">Structure Strength</span>
        <br />
            Particles stuck together = structure
            Water, shrinking, swelling, freezing, thawing, roots and animals cause particles to be pushed together and pulled apart
            Weak
            Aggregates break apart with little handling
            Moderate
            Soil removed from the horizon is aggregate
            Strong
            Aggregates do not readily fall apart when handled
            Structure is described for each horizon 
            Structure differences help define horizons
            Once particles are stuck together, they form structure
            Water and organic matter help particles stick together
            <br />
            <br />

        <span class="topic">Stability</span>
        <br />
            Measured as the resistance of aggregates to destruction by water
            Stabilizing agents found in soil (commonly found in B horizon) = helps to bind particles into aggregates
            Silicate clay
            Organic materials
            Oxides of iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al)
            <br />
            <br />

        <span class="topic">Consistence</span>
        <br />
            Measures soil cohesion (like +like) and adhesion (water + soil) and resistance to deformation or rupture
            Dry
            Sandy loam: individual grains do not stick together
            Moist
            Loose to extremely firm depending on the soil
            Wet
            Sticky
            <br />
                Humus<br />
                •	Highly decomposed organic matter<br />
                •	“organic glue” forming aggregates<br />
                •	Highly charged<br />
                •	Large surface area per unit mass<br />
            <br />
            

        <span class="topic">Clay influences soil as much as water. Why?</span>
        <br />
            Increases the hardness of dry soil
            Increases the firmness of moist soil
            Increases the stickiness and plasticity of wet soil
            <br />
