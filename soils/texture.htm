            The soil triangle is a tool that can help you do two things, you can find the 
            texture type when given percentages of sand, silt, and clay or if you have the 
            texture type you can approximate the percentages. Knowing the texture type of a 
            soil will help determine the usage of a particular land and wither or not you 
            realized it, soil’s texture affects your every day life. To learn more about 
            texture and particle size, you can <a href="soilhome.htm"> go to </a>the Soils page.
            <br />

            <span class="firstword">Using the Triangle</span>
            <br />
                Each side of the triangle has a scale of 0 to 100 percent. Whenever you use a new 
                triangle it is a good idea to take a moment and fimilarize youself with it because all 
                triangles may not have the exact layout. The triangle used here has Clay on the left, 
                Silt on the right and Sand at the bottom. Some triangles will have no visable grid 
                making it easier to see the area of each texture and some will have a grid to help 
                find the texture by precentage values.
                <br />
                <br />

                Starting with clay, its numbers are horozontal implying they horozontally divide the 
                triangle. Likewise, silt and sand have numbers are they angled and imply the direction 
                their lines are read across the triangle. By clicking Percent Clay, Percent Silt, and 
                Percent Sand in the picture, lines will highlight to make it easier for you to see how 
                the lines in each section divide the triangle.

        <span class="firstword">Let's Practice</span><br />
            Now that you understand the layout of the triangle, let's practice using it. If you 
            want to find a texture that has 20 percent sand, 70 percent silt and 10 percent clay, 
            click <a class="blueHi" onclick="document.images['triangle'].src='./images/soiltri_grey_grid.jpg'">
            Grid View</a> and then trace the value of each line until they meet.  
            <a class="blueHi" onclick="document.images['triangle'].src='./images/soiltri_trace1a.jpg'">
            Click here to see if you are correct</a>.
